# Companion to the objective anchor (Option C, in sddp.jl/master.jl); both share the

    wv_warmstart_cuts(net, anchor_vol, wv_values, decay_weights, lb) -> Vector{Dict{String,Any}}

Build one SDDP single-cut per reservoir per weekly node from prior water values,
in `SDDP.write_cuts_to_file` schema (ready for `apply_wv_warmstart!`).

For node `t` and reservoir `r` with downstream energy coeff `c_r > 0` and `wv_r != 0`:

    slope  π_{r,t} = decay_weights[t] · (−wv_r · c_r · MWH_PER_MM3_PER_SP)      [\$/Mm³]
    cut_t:  V(s) ≥ lb + Σ_r π_{r,t} · (s_r − anchor_vol_r)

i.e. point-slope anchored at `anchor_vol` (Mm³) with height `lb`. Reservoirs with
`c_r == 0` or zero/missing `wv` are skipped; a node whose cut would be empty is
omitted. Node names are `string(t)` for `t in 1:length(decay_weights)`; state keys
are `s[<reservoir>]` (matching `_fcf_state_key`).

    apply_wv_warmstart!(graph, cuts) -> graph

Inject `cuts` (from `wv_warmstart_cuts`) into `graph` by writing them to a temp file
in SDDP.jl's cut schema and loading via the public `SDDP.read_cuts_from_file`. Each
cut becomes `V(s) ≥ intercept + Σ coefficients·(s − state)` on its node's cost-to-go.
No-op when `cuts` is empty. Returns `graph`.
